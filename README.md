# 2015-2017-UK-General-Election-Forecast-via-Twitter-network-analysis
UCL disseratation


The motivation behind this project is to collect candidates' information from twitter and verify the feasibility of using candidates' twitter information to forecast UK General Election.  
In this work, we collected unique candidate based Twitter datasets from API. For each candidate, we also collected every tweet they posted one year before the public polling. In the feature extraction section, we did sentiment analysis, topic extraction, topic analysis, and network analysis to investigate and extract possible features that might be relevant to the election forecast. In the end, by using different machine learning classifiers, we proved that the twitter features played an important role in producing better prediction results.

The project makes the following contributions:
\begin{itemize}
\item
We collected unique candidate based Twitter datasets for 2015 and 2017 UK General Election. The datasets can be used for other complex network analysis task or election research.
\item
Simple information (incumbent and age) could produce a good prediction, especially the incumbent information is an important factor.
\item
The standalone candidate based twitter information can make accurate prediction. After combining the simple information mentioned above, we can achieve better prediction results
and our prediction results are perhaps much better than most polls. 
\item
Twitter, and online social networks, in general, will play an increasingly more important role; we need more study on social networks, such as second-order connectivity.   
\end{itemize}
